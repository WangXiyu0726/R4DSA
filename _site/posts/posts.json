Crime is a complex event which requires a law, an offender, and a target to intersect in a place at one time, which means that crimes may spatially cluster because the offenders might have invested their time and energy to master the “battleground,” or there might be more susceptible targets. Finding these spatial crime clusters would help the purpose to aid criminal apprehension, crime reduction, prevention, and evaluation. The driving record of the suspect has always been an important clue to most criminal cases. Through the analysis of the movement of individual people, we can find the suspect’s regular route and regular schedule which is the key in understanding patterns of their movements.\r\n2.Problem Statement\r\nDuring the celebration of GAStech’s IPO, several employees of the company were strangely missing. Fortunately, Many of the Abila, Kronos-based employees of GAStech have company cars which are approved for both personal and business use. These cars are equipped with GPS tracking devices, which can provide tracking data for two weeks before the disappearance (no data on the day of disappearance). Credit card and loyalty card transactions data are also provided for case investigation. Taking the GPS monitoring results of the company’s employees as a whole can help us understand whether the company has organized group activities at a specific time, such as company team building or overtime, which leads to unexpected group behavior. This helps the police find out the suspect’s unusual travel time and destination. As for the credit card and loyalty card consumption records can help us find out whether the suspect has suspiciously large expenditures, and investigate whether it is possible to purchase suspicious items as criminal tools of crime through the location and name of business of the purchased items.\r\n3.Lecture Review\r\nThere is an increasing trend of usage of line plots, geographic maps, heat maps, histograms, and graphs for time series data. Below is the lecture review of several examples of interactive visual analysis available.\r\n3.1 Regional Map\r\nRegional map can be used to analyze data by region, reflecting the basic natural and economic conditions and regional characteristics of a certain region. The most common example is the administrative area map, which can realize the level-by-level drilling from the province to the city and realize the different degrees of color and label for a certain characteristic. For example, the sales in the figure below can be drilled from province to city. The larger the sales, the darker the color.\r\n3.2 Heatmap\r\nThe heatmap is used to convert data into color tones within the geographic coordinate system, and intuitively reflect the distribution, frequency or density of the data in the geographic space through the degree of color change. The following figure shows the level of PM2.5 in environmental monitoring in various regions of the country.\r\n3.3 Bubble Map\r\nBubble map is a very common visualization map related to geographic location information. It can transmit multi-dimensional information at the same time. The location of the bubble is used to transmit physical location information. The size of the bubble indicates the value of variable 1, and the color of the bubble can be identified. The size/category of variable 2 can be produced as a .gif with a time frame to represent the change of each variable over time.\r\n3.4 Flow Map\r\nThe flow map displays information or the movement of objects from one location to another and the number of objects on the map. Usually used to display migration data of people, animals, and products. The scale or number of movements represented by a single flow line is represented by its thickness, which helps to show the geographical distribution of migration activities. The flow map is mostly used in scenarios such as interregional trade, traffic flow, population migration, shopping and consumption behavior, communication information flow, and aviation routes. It can also be applied to enterprise cargo transportation and supply chain management. The movement path of the migrants during the Spring Festival is shown in the following figure.\r\n3.5 Trajectory graph\r\nDifferent lines can be identified by different colors, and the size of the line thickness is used to indicate the size of the passenger flow. The thicker the line, the greater the passenger flow, and it can also indicate the direction of the track line. Operators can use this visualization effect to intuitively judge the distribution of passenger flow in a certain period of time and the ride behavior of different routes in order to arrange operations reasonably.\r\n4. Step by Step Guide\r\n4.1 Set Up Environment\r\n4.1.1 Installing and Launcingh R Packages\r\nThe code chunk below will check if the R packages have been installed, if not, R will install the missing packages before launching them.\r\n4.1.2 Plotting Raster Layer\r\nFirst, import MC2-tourist.jpg into R by using raster() of Raster package and name it as “bgmap”. Then use tm_rgb() to plot the raster layer and name the picture as “bgmap1”.\r\n4.1.3 Importing Vector GIS Data File\r\nBecause Abila GIS data layer is in ESRI shapefile format, which is in vector data model with line feature class, we need to use st_read() of sf package to import it into R. Name it as “Abila_st”.\r\n4.1.4 Importing GPS Tracking Data\r\nThis code chunk import “gps.csv” into R by using “read_csv()” of readr package. We need to change the original “Timestamp” field into date-time format using data-time_parse() of clock package, and change id field as factor data type using as_factor() of factors package.\r\nThen, use st_as_sf() of sf packages to convert gps data set into a simple feature data set.Now, each row in the gps_sf table represents the coordinates of the vehicle at a specific time, which can be regarded as a point on the map.\r\n4.1.5 Importing the Transaction Data\r\nImport“loyalty_data.csv” and “cc_data” using “read_csv()” and change the format of the timestamp.\r\n4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis\r\n4.2.1 Transaction Data Exploration\r\nExtract the two columns of timestamp and location from the original data table of credit card and loyalty card, and add a column as label.\r\nAs can be seen from the bar chart below, there are four shops that are obviously more popular compared with merchants: Katerina’s Cafe, Hippokampos, Guy’s Gyros and Brew’ve Been Served.\r\nDerive date and hour from timestamp, adding to the table. \r\nThrough the observation of the heatmap, it can be inferred that the merchant’s business hours are 7-21 o’clock on weekdays and 12-20 o’clock on weekends, of which 7 o’clock, 12-13 o’clock and 20 o’clock are the morning, middle and evening peak hours of the day. Therefore, visits during non-business hours can be regarded as abnormal situations worthy of the police’s attention. \r\nJudging from the scatter plot of the transaction volume of each store, the overall consumption is relatively even. Among these stores, the transaction data of a few stores is more prominent, but none of them has a single transaction exceeding 5000 dollars. However, there is indeed an extreme outlier appeared in Frydos Autosupply n’ More, with a single transaction amount of 10,000, which is likely to be the behavior of the suspect. \r\n4.2.2 Geospatial Data Exploration\r\nThrough the following code, we can get all the image of driving route records of all suspects during the specified time period, which is very overlapping and messy and cannot help the police to distinguish.\r\nSo, we should use the code chunk below joins the gps points into movement paths by using the drivers’ IDs as unique identifiers.\r\nThe code chunk below is used to overplot the gps path of driver ID 1 onto the background tourist map. \r\n4.2.3 Card Ownership\r\nBecause both the consumption data of the cards and the driving record data have timestamp variable, we can use the same time variables in these two tables to identify which vehicles stayed at a specific merchant at a specific time. And then find the corresponding consumers through the vehicle assignment data table, so that we can generate a list including all associations of card numbers and consumers. The combinations that appear frequently in multiple lists, that is, the association with the highest frequency, can be preliminarily determined as the ownership between the card and the consumer.\r\nHowever, this method will have some limitations, because we use the dispatching relationship of the car as a medium to determine the relationship between the cards and the consumers. In fact, unexpected situations are likely to occur, for example, people use cards other than their own to make a transaction, or someone drives someone else’s car to spend at the merchant.\r\n4.2.4 Potential Relationship\r\nWe can use timestamp and location indicator of transaction data to group card numbers to find out which cards are used for consumption at the same merchant at the same time.Through this result, we can utilize the result of the previous question to find the owners of the cards in a one-to-one correspondence. People in the same timestamp-location group may have had contact, which enables the police to infer potential relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Readers cannot know the time range of the data, nor can they know why these ten markets are selected as representatives.\r\nIn the picture, a label is provided for each country’s point, only showing a value, but does not indicate that the value represents the total import and export value of the market.\r\nThere is no labeling unit on the horizontal and vertical axes, and the placement of the variable names of the axes is easy to confuse the reader.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe image background color setting is not necessary, which can easily distract readers. Also, the background colors of net importer and net exporter are too similar, which makes it difficult for readers to notice and distinguish the characteristics of which country at the first glance.\r\nThe position of the label corresponding to each circle is chaotic. The label of some circles will block the center white point of other circles. For the circles near the boundary point, it is difficult to determine which area their center point lies in.\r\nThe transparency of the dots is too low, which is a big problem for areas with dense dots. For example, the dots in Japan have almost completely covered the dots in Korea.\r\nThe content of Note is not conspicuous and redundant.\r\n2.0 Alternative Design\r\nThis figure corrects the problems in the original figure, such as the problem of ambiguous titles, labels, and variable units. This figure removes the overall background color and the background colors of net importer and net exporter, and retains the diversified colors assigned to different countries for distinction. In addition, it omits the note below the original image and simplifies the marked icon, using the tooltip instead to provide more detailed content.\r\n* Chart 1 is the Motion Chart of Top 10 Trade Volume Market, which provides detailed data of each market at various time points, including import volume, export volume, total trade volume and ranking. Besides, it can also show users the dynamic growth orbit of each country from 2011 to 2020.\r\n* Chart 2 is the Interactive Bubble Plot of Top 10 Trade Volume Market, which shows the overall trade volume of each market within the time range of 2011 to 2020 by connecting the line chart of sheet 3. Users can obtain the line chart of the import and export volume of the market during the decade by placing the mouse on the dot.\r\n3.0 Proposed Visualization\r\nPlease view the interactive visualization on Tableau Public here.\r\n4.0 Step-by-step Guide\r\n\r\nImport the metadata table, drag the new union of the left panel to the top of the main panel, and then drag the T1 and T2 on the left panel to the dialog window as shown in the picture.\r\nThe imported results (corresponding to the left and right sides of the table respectively) are shown in the figure. Next, we will deal with the leftmost column and the two rightmost columns of the table.\r\nFirst, right-click the header of the first column, and select split, then two new columns will appear as shown.\r\nBy observing column “Variables-Split 2”, we find that the majority of the markets use thousand, and only a few use million as a unit. At the same time, it is shown that the corresponding data of the market using million are all null values, so we can ignore this problem, which does not affect our subsequent operations. Then, rename the column “Variables-Split 1” as “Market”, and hide the other two columns.\r\nAs for the two rightmost columns of the table, create calculated field named “Indicator”, so that we can get a new column to help us distinguish the indicators of import and export.\r\nThen hide column “Sheet” and “Table Name”.\r\nSelect all months’ data, right-click the header of any one of the columns, select pivot.\r\nRename these two new columns as “Date” and “Trade Volume” and change their datatype into Date and Number.\r\nNow we can move to Sheet 1. First, we use create calculated filed function to derive two new variables “Import” and “Export” using the formula shown above. Now, two more variables appear in the left panel. Going back to the Data Source interface, we also find that there are two new columns at the end of the table.\r\nDrag “Export” to Columns and drag “Import” to Rows. Now only one point is shown on the screen.\r\nDrag “Market” to Detail, now each point represents a market.\r\nDrag “Date” to Filter panel, and Filter Filed dialog window appear, then select “Range of Date”. Set the range from 2011-01-01 to 2020-12-31.\r\nNow we want to add a reference line to distinguish the net importer and net exporter, using create calculated filed function, makes the “Reference Line” equals to “Export”.\r\nDrag “Reference Line” to the righthand side axis, right-click the axis and select Synchronise Axis and Show Header.\r\nChange Automatic to Line at the dropdown list of SUM(Reference Line) sub-panel, then right-click one of the point on the line and choose Trend Lines — Show Trend Lines.\r\nWe have made the reference line, but there are many points on it, which greatly affect the cleanliness of the picture. To solve this problem, we can change the transparency to 0, and we can also change the line to a more suitable color.\r\nAdding “Reference Line” to Filter enables us to eliminate the null values.\r\nCreate calculated field “Total Trade Volume”, which means the total trade volume of a specific market within a certain period.\r\nAdd “Market” to filter, exclude the Total Merchandise data and choose the Top 10 Market by “Total Trade Volume”.\r\nChange Automatic to Circle, drag Market to Size and set an appropriate size. lower the transparency.\r\nCreate calculated field “Label” to identify whether the specific market is a net importer or a net exporter.\r\nCreate calculate field “Ranking by Net Importer” and “Ranking by Net Exporter”.\r\nDrag these three new derived variables to Tooltip. Press the triangle symbol behind “Ranking by Net Importer” and select Edit Table Calculation. Change compute using to Specific Dimensions and tick the box of Market.\r\nDrag “Market” to Colour and Edit Tooltip as shown above. Now it enables the users get detailed information about the market while placing the mouse on any point.\r\nDrag “YEAR(Date)” to Page panel, click Format—Animations, turn Workbook Default on and set the Duration to 0.5 seconds. Show the filter and rename the title of the chart.\r\nDuplicate sheet 1 and remove “YEAR(Date)” from Page pane, now we can move to sheet 3 to create a line chart.\r\nDrag “Date” to Columns and drag ”Export” and “Import” to Rows.\r\nRight-click the right-hand side axis and click Synchronise Axis and Show Header. Rename the left-hand side axis to “Trade Volume”.\r\nDrag “Market” and “Date” to Filter pane, Apply to Worksheets—Selected Worksheets—Interactive Bubble Plot.\r\nEnter Edit Tooltip window, click Insert dropdown list and chose Line Chart under Sheets.\r\nNow when we hover the mouse on the dot, the trade volume line chart of the market in 2011-2020 will be displayed.\r\n5.0 Derived Insights\r\nFrom 2011 to 2020, China’s import and export volume has maintained a steady growth trend, and in 2013 it surpassed Malaysia to become the largest trade market. Taiwan has also maintained its upward momentum, and according to the line chart, Taiwan is very likely to have a milestone with a trade deficit in 2021. On the contrary, Indonesia keep decreasing both in import volume and export volume during the decade.\r\nIn the past ten years, Hong Kong has maintained a floating state close to the axis of abscissas, with export volume multiples greater than the import volume. Germany, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea showed similar patterns that their import volume trends are relatively stable, while the export volume fluctuates significantly.\r\nNet exporters are mostly market of developing countries, such as China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. While net importers are mostly market of developed countries, such as the United States, Japan, and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The x-axis of the Japanese chart is obviously the shortest. Also, “month period” is marked below, but there are no tick marks to reflect month. The intervals of the y-axis are inconsistent, which makes it difficult to intuitively compare the import and export trade volumes of different countries.\r\nThe unit is different. Hong Kong’s import indicator uses thousand US dollars as the unit, which is different from the million US dollars used by other indicators.\r\nThe coordinate axes on the left and right sides of the chart represent the import and export respectively, which is not concise and unnecessary. and it is easy to cause confusion for readers.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe title is not eye-catching enough. The font size is not different from other characters, and it is not bold.\r\nThe note “Month of period” below is redundant, because the month can be directly reflected by the interval of the abscissa.\r\nThe six charts are typeset in two rows, which makes it difficult for users to compare their values on the vertical axis.\r\n2.0 Alternative Design\r\nThe horizonal axis of the chart is the year (2019-2020), and the vertical axis is the merchandise trade volume (in thousands of U.S. dollars). The chart provides users with three options on the right-hand side panel:\r\nCountry/Region: Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, Japan, Malaysia, ALL\r\nIndicators: Import, Export, Trade deficit, ALL\r\nMonth: 1-12, ALL\r\nCategory: Import, Export, ALL\r\nThe chart uses six different colors to represent six countries/regions and uses different color saturations to distinguish three indicator variables, which enable the users to perform diversified combinations under the circumstance of the given months or a month period, such as comparing the import indicators of multiple selected countries, comparing multiple indicators of specified country. In addition, the user can also select a specific month or month range. The user can select January and December as a month range to obtain a polyline of annual changes. Users can also choose March, June, September, and December as the indicators at the end of each quarter, so that the corresponding four points will be marked on the polyline. The upper right corner of all polylines will show the growth rate or decline rate of the selected month range.\r\n3.0 Proposed Visualization\r\nPlease view the interactive visualization on Tableau Public here.\r\n4.0 Step-by-step Guide\r\nImport Data and combine two tables.\r\nRemove the redundant rows and columns. Rename table and headers.\r\nChange the data type of the trade volume into number.\r\nDrug Measure Values to the Column tab, and drug Measure Name and Country/Region to the Rows tab. Add all months with SUM function into measure values.\r\nClick view data in Tableau and export two tables of Import and Export.\r\nCombine these two tables and insert a column named Category on the right side of the combined table. Import the cleaned data into Tableau and change the data type as shown.\r\nAdd Category, YEAR(Date), MONTH(Date) to the Column tab and SUM(Trade Volume) to the Rows tab.\r\nAdd Category, YEAR(Date), MONTH(Date), Country/Region to Filter and show them in the right panel.\r\nAdd Category to the Colour option to differentiate the performance of the Export Volume and Import Volume.\r\nAdd another copy of SUM(Trade Volume) and change it to dual axis.\r\nRight click on the right Y-axis, select Synchronize Axis and deselect Show Header.\r\nChange panel from Automatic to Circle and choose an appropriate size for the mark.\r\n5.0 Derived Insights\r\nDuring these two years, Hong Kong’s exports were significantly more than imports, while Taiwan’s was the opposite.\r\nThe U.S. economy showed a trade deficit in 2019, and this situation was reversed in 2020.\r\nMainland China is the largest import and export economy in the world, and the overall trend is steadily increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
